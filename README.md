# Automatic Orientation of Complete Mandibles

This package, created as part of an MSc thesis in the ViSA project at Cranfield University, uses geometric analysis to align and "slice" 3D point clouds of human mandibles.

The core function is batch(), which calls various other functions to batch process point clouds.
